# iOSPlateSolver
iOS app that interacts with astrometry.net to do [plate solving](https://nova.astrometry.net/) in the field.

This is a very basic app. When installed add your [API key](https://nova.astrometry.net/api_help) by tapping the gear icon in the upper right.
Then from the main view you can take a picture which will be uploaded to astrometry.net's service. The app will refresh the status every 10 seconds and
will download the solved annotated image when available.

### Installing
I don't have plans to distribute this app so you will need to clone this repository, build it in Xcode and install it to your device.

### Development
Feel free to open issues or Pull Requests in this repo and I will get to them as I'm able.
